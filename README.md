### 🚧 Under construction

These images are built from each phone's stock firmware and have not been tried
on the phone. They set up the screen, touch, WLAN and vibration, and do not decrypt
the data partition.

## Installing

Skyward needs an unlocked bootloader. Download the zip for your phone from
[Releases](https://github.com/kirklin/skyward/releases), where each shows as the
phone's model and codename, such as Xiaomi 17 Ultra (nezha). Check it against
`SHA256SUMS`, unzip it, and flash the image inside to the recovery partition of
the slot the phone runs from, with the phone in fastboot mode:

```sh
unzip skyward-v0.1.2-nezha-OS4.0.4.0.XPACNXM.zip
fastboot flash recovery skyward-v0.1.2-nezha-OS4.0.4.0.XPACNXM.img
fastboot reboot recovery
```

Afterwards a newer image, unzipped, installs from Skyward's own Install page. With
**Flash Skyward again** on, a system update or zip that writes over the recovery
partitions gets Skyward back in them.

Without a system in super, Skyward still starts, with its screen and keys, adb,
`adb sideload` and fastbootd, enough to install one. Touch, WLAN and decryption run
from the installed system and come back with it.

adb in Skyward is a root shell that needs no authorization on the phone: anyone
with the phone and a cable can reach its storage while it is in recovery.

## Building

Skyward builds with the stable Rust that `rust-toolchain.toml` names, with its
`aarch64-linux-android` target, the Android NDK r29 and
[cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk). The recovery service is built for
the phone, and the packer for the computer:

```sh
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 30 build --release -p skyward
cargo build --release -p skyward-pack
```

The packer takes the stock recovery partition out of the build's full update
package on Xiaomi's server, reading only the part of the package the partition is
in, and checks its SHA-256 against the device file:

```sh
target/release/skyward-pack stock --config devices/nezha.toml --out target/stock/nezha/recovery.img
```

Then it builds the image on top of it:

```sh
target/release/skyward-pack recovery \
  --stock target/stock/nezha/recovery.img \
  --binary target/aarch64-linux-android/release/skyward \
  --config devices/nezha.toml \
  --font resources/fonts/MiSansVF.ttf \
  --mono resources/fonts/KirkMono-Regular.ttf \
  --mono-license resources/fonts/KirkMono-OFL.txt \
  --out target/skyward-nezha.img
```

Tests and lints run on the computer; what runs only on the phone is linted for it:

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 30 clippy -p skyward -p skyward-install -- -D warnings
```

`skyward-preview` draws the pages on the computer, as PNG files, without a phone:
each page whole, as a long screenshot shows it, in the states it can be in, and the
screen at moments of touches and motion. `--lang` picks the language by a locale
such as `en` or `zh-TW`:

```sh
cargo run --release -p skyward-preview -- target/preview --lang en
```
