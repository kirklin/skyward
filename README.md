## Features

- Decrypt the data partition
- Install zips, system update packages and partition images, from internal storage, a USB drive or adb sideload
- `7za` and `zstd` for install scripts, which ROMs with a super image compressed by zstd use to flash it, and an `unzip` whose `-p` streams the image as it reads it
- `avbctl` and `resetprop` for install scripts, to turn off verified boot's checks and to read and set properties
- Online system updates
- Skyward's own updates, from its newest release on GitHub
- Backup and restore
- Wipe data and factory reset
- Mount partitions, repair and format filesystems
- File manager and terminal
- WLAN
- MTP file transfer, adb and fastbootd
- Reboot to system, recovery, fastboot, bootloader or EDL, and switch slots
- Dual boot: a second system beside the installed one, its files in the data partition, picked from two cards on the home page's Dual boot and switched to with a swipe
- Light and dark themes; Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and English

## Supported devices

### 🚧 Under construction

These images are built from each phone's stock firmware and have not been tried
on the phone. They set up the screen, touch, WLAN and vibration, and do not decrypt
the data partition.

## Installing

Skyward needs an unlocked bootloader. Download the zip for your phone from
[Releases](https://github.com/kirklin/skyward/releases), where each shows as the
phone's model and codename, such as Xiaomi 17 Ultra (nezha). Check it against
`SHA256SUMS`, unzip it, and flash the image inside to the recovery partition of
the slot the phone runs from, with the phone in fastboot mode:

```sh
unzip skyward-v0.1.6-nezha-OS4.0.4.0.XPACNXM.zip
fastboot flash recovery skyward-v0.1.6-nezha-OS4.0.4.0.XPACNXM.img
fastboot reboot recovery
```

Afterwards Skyward updates itself over Wi-Fi from its newest release, on the
Skyward update page in Settings; a newer image, unzipped, also installs from its own
Install page. With **Flash Skyward again** on, a system update or zip that writes
over the recovery partitions gets Skyward back in them.

Without a system in super, Skyward still starts, with its screen and keys, adb,
`adb sideload` and fastbootd, enough to install one. Touch, WLAN and decryption run
from the installed system and come back with it.

adb in Skyward is a root shell that needs no authorization on the phone: anyone
with the phone and a cable can reach its storage while it is in recovery.

## Dual boot

Skyward installs a second system beside the one in the phone's own partitions,
whether that is HyperOS or a custom ROM, and switches between them from **Dual boot**
on its home page. The second system's root is a file in the data partition that the
filesystem may neither move nor delete, read and written through the partition
itself; the boot images of both systems are kept in another such file. A switch
writes only the boot and init_boot partitions of the slot that starts next, and
keeps each step on /metadata first, so a switch cut off by a loss of power is
finished when Skyward next starts. vendor_boot, dtbo, recovery, vbmeta, the firmware
and super stay as they are, and the second system starts with the installed
system's vendor_boot and dtbo.

The second system waits while a system update is still to be merged.

A second system installs from a zip on the Install page, as any other package does:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `system.toml` | `id`, `name`, `version` and `filesystem`; `init`, the program the root starts with, `/sbin/init` unless given; `minimum`, the least room the root takes, in bytes |
| `boot.img` | The kernel the bootloader starts |
| `rootfs.img` | The root filesystem's image, of the `filesystem` named |
| `init_boot.img` | Only for a system with a first ramdisk of its own |

A system without an init_boot image of its own starts from one Skyward makes. Its
program loads the installed system's first-stage kernel modules the way that
system's first stage loads them, with their soft dependencies and the settings the
kernel command line gives them, finds the root in the data partition, mounts it and
starts `init` there. If anything stops it, it says why in the kernel's log and stays
where it stopped. A system with a first ramdisk of its own finds Skyward's program
at `/skyward/map`, which lays the root out as a block device and prints its node.
Each switch to the second system writes its init_boot image with the program of the
Skyward that switches, so an updated Skyward starts it with the new program.

A running system switches by writing `boot-recovery` with
`--switch_system=installed`, or `--switch_system=` and the second system's `id`, to
misc, and restarting into recovery.

## Building

Skyward builds with the stable Rust that `rust-toolchain.toml` names, with its
`aarch64-linux-android` target, the Android NDK r29 and
[cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk). The recovery service is built for
the phone, and the packer for the computer:

```sh
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 30 build --release -p skyward
cargo build --release -p skyward-pack
```

The second system's first program runs before any library is there to load, so it
is built as a static program:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static" cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 30 build --release -p skyward-system-init --target-dir target/system-init
```

The packer takes the stock recovery partition out of the build's full update
package on Xiaomi's server, reading only the part of the package the partition is
in, and checks its SHA-256 against the device file:

```sh
target/release/skyward-pack stock --config devices/nezha.toml --out target/stock/nezha/recovery.img
```

Then it builds the image on top of it:

```sh
target/release/skyward-pack recovery \
  --stock target/stock/nezha/recovery.img \
  --binary target/aarch64-linux-android/release/skyward \
  --system-init target/system-init/aarch64-linux-android/release/system-init \
  --config devices/nezha.toml \
  --font resources/fonts/MiSansVF.ttf \
  --mono resources/fonts/KirkMono-Regular.ttf \
  --mono-license resources/fonts/KirkMono-OFL.txt \
  --out target/skyward-nezha.img
```

Tests and lints run on the computer; what runs only on the phone is linted for it:

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 30 clippy -p skyward -p skyward-install -p skyward-systems -p skyward-system-init -- -D warnings
```

`skyward-preview` draws the pages on the computer, as PNG files, without a phone:
each page whole, as a long screenshot shows it, in the states it can be in, and the
screen at moments of touches and motion. `--lang` picks the language by a locale
such as `en` or `zh-TW`:

```sh
cargo run --release -p skyward-preview -- target/preview --lang en
```
